## Bug tickets

You may submit patches to this project by forking this repository and making a pull request.
If you want to become a regular contributor, please contact us on discord (check README for the link).
We appreciate all kinds of contributions, whether it's big or small. We also very enthusiastically
welcome bug tickets and improvement suggestions on our bug tracker!

When filing tickets, please first make sure that a ticket does not already exist about your
topic. If one exists, add to the existing ticket if necessary. If a ticket does not yet exist,
feel free to open up a new one. Please make sure that you file as much information as possible
to make it easier for us to track the problem:

In bug tickets, include at least the following:
* Your OS (and OS version)
* Any logs generated by the game (if using a debug build)
* As detailed an explanation of the problem as possible, as concisely as possible. This is really
  important!

For feature tickets, we are currently interested only in certain things (more
detailed list below or in milestones view). Before contributing features, make sure to pop in
to #omf channel on freenode and check if the feature is not yet being developed by someone!

Currently we are working on:
* the basic fighting mechanics and animations
* responsive input system
* scoring system
* graphical effects on arenas
* robot and fighter stats and statistics

Please see our milestones page for more details on these!
