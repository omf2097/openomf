[![CI](https://github.com/omf2097/openomf/actions/workflows/compilation.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/omf2097/openomf/actions/workflows/compilation.yml)

OpenOMF is an Open Source remake of "One Must Fall 2097" by Diversions
Entertainment. Since the original DOS game from 1994 uses IPX networking and
is a pain to set up, the community needed a better solution to keep playing
the game we love. Together with networking, we try to make it easier to play
One Must Fall in its original glory on multiple platforms (Linux, Mac OSX,
Windows, BSD to name a few).
